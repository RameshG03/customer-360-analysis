# 🛒 Customer 360 Retail Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs a **Customer 360 Retail Sales Analysis** to understand customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and sales trends using **Python and Power BI**.

The goal of this project is to transform raw retail transaction data into meaningful insights that support **business decision making and sales strategy**.

The analysis includes:

• Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis  
• Customer Retention Analysis using Cohort Analysis  
• Product Association using Market Basket Analysis  
• Interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI

# 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains retail transaction records including:

- Customer ID
- Invoice Date
- Product Category
- Sales Amount
- Order Information
- Delivery Type
- Region

Total transactions analyzed: **~397,000**

# 🧠 Python Analysis

Python was used for advanced customer and sales analysis.

## 1️⃣ RFM Analysis (Customer Segmentation)

RFM stands for:

- **Recency** → How recently a customer purchased
- **Frequency** → How often a customer purchases
- **Monetary** → How much money the customer spends

Customers were scored from **1–5** for each metric and grouped into segments such as:

- Champions
- Loyal Customers
- Recent Customers
- At Risk
- Hibernating

This helps businesses identify **high-value customers and design targeted marketing strategies.**

---

## 2️⃣ Cohort Analysis (Customer Retention)

Cohort analysis groups customers based on their **first purchase month** and tracks their activity over time.

This helps measure:

• Customer retention  
• Customer lifetime engagement  
• Loyalty patterns  

---

## 3️⃣ Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis identifies products that customers frequently purchase together.

The **Apriori algorithm** was used to generate association rules.

Example rule:

Product A → Product B

Meaning customers who buy Product A are also likely to buy Product B.

This helps businesses improve:

• Cross-selling strategies  
• Product bundling  
• Recommendation systems

# 📈 Power BI Dashboard

Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard showing:

• Total Sales and Profit  
• Sales by Category and Region  
• Profit vs Sales Trends  
• Customer Distribution  
• Delivery Performance  
• Pareto Sales Analysis (80/20 Rule)

These dashboards help businesses **monitor performance and make data-driven decisions**.

# 📊 Key Insights

• A small number of product categories generate the majority of sales (Pareto principle).  
• High-value customers contribute significantly to revenue.  
• Customer retention decreases after the first few months.  
• Certain products are frequently purchased together.

These insights help businesses improve **sales strategies and marketing decisions**.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project follows an end-to-end data analytics pipeline:

Retail Dataset → Python Data Processing → PostgreSQL Database → Power BI Dashboard

1. Raw retail transaction data is processed using **Python (Pandas)**.
2. Customer analytics such as **RFM segmentation, Cohort Analysis, and Market Basket Analysis** are performed.
3. The processed results are stored in a **PostgreSQL database**.
4. **Power BI** connects to the database to create interactive dashboards for business insights.
